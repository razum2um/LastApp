To build this project:

$ git submodule update --recursive --init
$ wget -O theos/include/substrate.h https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theos/lib/master/CydiaSubstrate.framework/Headers/CydiaSubstrate.h

# on macOS you can do this, otherwise export SYSROOT=<path to root of iOS SDK>
$ export SYSROOT=$(xcrun --sdk iphoneos --show-sdk-path)
$ make

# to create a .deb package that can be installed on your device
$ make package
```

NOTE: While I would prefer that you do not distribute your own package, and that
      you would instead submit any patches to me instead, if you do decide to
      distribute, *please* be certain to:

1. Rename your package identifier (Package:) and name (Name:).
   Do *not* use the original project name (e.g. "Backgrounder", "LastApp", etc).
2. Change the author/maintainer information.
3. Make your package conflicts with the original (my) package.
4. Be sure to follow the rules of the license.
   - The original author must be credited for the original work,
     and *only* the original work - not any changes made by you.
